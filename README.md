# CS1101

This is a repository for WPI CS1101 Introduction to Program Design for A-term 2021 with Professor Engling.

In this repo, you will find 6 projects. Each project serves as both our submissions for labs and homework, as the lab potion of this course was just to complete the first part of the homework.
All code was either provided in a starter file and expanded upon by or written from scratch by myself and my homework partner.

# IMPORTANT
This repo is for reference and educational purposes only. Please do your own work and not directly copy our code. There is no guarantee that all the code is perfect, and runs smoothly, and copying does not promote academic integrity. Instead use the code as a guide for the ideas and strategies for programming the assignments. Thank You - Brendan Hoag & Adelynn Martin
